Rune Factory 3 - Lesbian Weresheep Edition 1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like the Story of Seasons series it spin off from, Rune Factory has always had a
strong LGBT+ fanbase, yet shied away from providing explicitly LGBT content
or romance options. While today many talented romhackers have set about patching
that in to older Story of Seasons/Harvest Moon games, the Rune Factory games 
have largely had to remain as they were. Until now.

Rune Factory 3 seemed a logical choice for this hack for several reasons. For 
one, it was my favorite of the original three DS games in the series. For 
another, the protagonist had been described by both the series' creators, fans 
and in-universe characters as being "more feminine" than even your average soft 
anime farm boi. More to the point, Micah looks like the kind of spunky, peppy 
anime lesbian a number of real-life lesbians I know would make a picrew of. 
The game's central gimmick of Micah's sheep form was also easy to work with 
because what kind of a creep is gonna look at an anime sheep, pull out their 
anime sheep gender callipers and go "hey, that sheep's a BOY!" 
A weird sheep creep, that's who!

What this hack changes:
   * Micah is now a woman, and referred to as such in the script and events.
   * The swimsuit costume now appropriately covers up Micah's lady nipples both 
     in her portrait and on her 3D model's texture, as society seems to have 
     some issue with lady nipples being as visible as dude nipples. Look, I 
     can't patch society.
   * Audio clips that refer to Micah's gender are edited to either refer to her
     as a woman, or no longer mention gender at all.
   * The original game had a surprising amount of jokes regarding Micah "looking
     like a girl" or "being girly" and such. These jokes have either rewritten 
     or replaced to make logical sense with Micah's current gender.
   * A handful of typos and grammatical errors in the original script have been
     fixed.

What this hack does not change:
   * The story and script, aside from the aforementioned "girly Micah" jokes, 
     has not been altered.
   * The bathrooms. I couldn't figure out how to do the kind of event editing
     that would require. Luckily, the game barely mentions gendered bathrooms
     and nothing happens if you try to enter the women's bath anyway, so let's
     all politely pretend that Sharance has a unisex bathhouse and Micah just
     prefers the right side for unknown reasons.
   * How babies work. You'll still get your wife pregnant. Sometimes a lady
     gets another lady pregnant if they try hard enough. It happens.
   * Any other bugs or glitches that may be found in the original version will 
     still be here.

This hack was made possible due to the hard work of previous romhackers and 
fan-translators who made my work a LOT easier with their tools and documentation.
This includes the Rune Factory 2/3 Text Dumper by CUE, Tinke by pleoNeX, and the
